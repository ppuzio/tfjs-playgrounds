This repo contains some of my experiments with TensorFlow.

### Square Neural Network

Simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which detects whether a 64x64px image contains a square or not.

Generates x squares and other shapes (circles, rectangles, triangles) which are then converted and used to test the network

To launch:

1. Install dependencies using `yarn`
2. Launch `yarn everything` or go through each step
